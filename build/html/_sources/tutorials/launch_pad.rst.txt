   Dungeon Architect - List of Builders


Dungeon Architect supports many different types of dungeon layout methods and is designed in a way that new layout methods can be easily added in the future

These layout methods are called `Dungeon Builders` or **Builders** in short

This section lets you create a new scene preconfigured with one of the builder templates.  Click on any of the builders. In the next screen, click the ``Clone Scene`` button

This will create a new scene based on the template, fully configured with the appropriate dungeon.  It will also clone a starting theme file (and any other flow graph assets) and set everything up.  



Choose a folder to saved your scene file.  Once saved, the launcher would do the following:

* Open the new scene
* Open any theme editor windows associated with the referenced assets (Theme Editor, Flow Graph Editors etc)
* Select the dungeon game object (so you see the properties in the inspector by default)
